# Simply framework
[Simply Framework](https://amorfx.github.io/simply-documentation/) is a **WordPress framework** that give you the Symfony dependency injection component and Twig php template engine.

Simply is not a framework that will lose you if you have been developing for some time on WordPress.

It will allow you to save development time by offering you dependency injection as well as the automation of recurring tasks on WordPress.

## Installation
All installation and documentation is [available here](https://amorfx.github.io/simply-documentation/docs/getting-started/installation). Read it carefully.

## Philosophy

The framework follows several important points in order not to complicate the development:
- do not modify the overall structure of WordPress
- avoid adding a large overlay which would make plugin or theme development more complex
- simplify added WordPress things with automated process (post type, taxonomy...)
- use Object-oriented programming

This is why the framework was developed as a WordPress must use plugin

## Development team
The framework was created by [Clément Décou](https://www.clement-decou.fr), who continues to lead the development.
